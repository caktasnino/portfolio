# Cakta≈° Nino - Portfolio

I'm a self-taught Fullstack Developer. I started my education as a Frontend Developer, but soon I got challenge to develop Web Application, in that process I fell in love with PHP and Laravel. My passion for building user friendly Frontend Webpages didn't disappear, so I decided to study more and become Fullstack Developer.


I specialize working with CMS platforms such as WordPress, developing Web Aplications using PHP and Laravel and managing Databases using MySQL and PHPMyAdmin.


When it comes to developing User Interfaces, I work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sometimes work is more complicated so I had to learn how to use tools such as Adobe PhotoShop and Illustrator, Figma and other tools.


I am currently looking for work and I am always interested in a challenge, reach out to caktasnino@gmail.com
